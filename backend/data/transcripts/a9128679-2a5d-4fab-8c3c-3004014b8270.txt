[00:05] Speaker 0: Hey. Did you finish the AI assignment? Almost. I'm stuck on the last part. NeoPods is confusing me. Same. I spent two hours just fixing connection address. Don't remind me. My code finally ran at 2AM. That's dedication. Did you understand the recommendation logic? A bit. I watched the YouTube video, and it helped. Send me the link later, please. Sure. By the way, are you coming to class today? Yeah. But only after lunch. I need sleep. Fair enough. College life is dead deadlines and coffee. True. But at least we are learning cool stuff. Yeah. Yeah. This project will look good on our resume. Definitely. Let's finish it properly. Deal. We will help each other till submission. Always. Teamwork for the win. Don't end it white.
