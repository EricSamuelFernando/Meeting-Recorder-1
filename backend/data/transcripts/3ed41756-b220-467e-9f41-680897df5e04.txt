[00:02] Speaker 0: Hey. Did you finish the AI assignment? Almost. I'm stuck on the last part. Neo four days confusing me. Same. I spent two hours just to fixing connection errors. Don't remind me my profile. I ran at 2AM. That's dedication. Did you understand the recommendation logic? I bet. I watched the YouTube video, and it helped. Send me the link later, please. Sure. By the way, are you coming to class today? Yeah. But only after lunch. I need sleep. Fair enough. Call, like, is just deadlines and coffee. True. But at least we are learning cool stuff. Yeah. Yeah. This project will look good on our resume. Definitely. Let's finish it properly. Deal. We will help each other. That's a mission. Always. Teamwork for the win.
