[00:26] Speaker 0: Yeah. I have two weekly.
[00:30] Speaker 1: Okay. Let us discuss some some, technical stuff. So what are you working on right now?
[00:38] Speaker 0: Yeah. Present, I'm working on a fathom style recorder. Same just like that. I have built a recorder which can record the Google Meet reading, and it will give the summary transcript so that we can go for the next changes based on that.
[00:54] Speaker 1: Oh, that's a great idea, actually. So, shall I say what exactly I have did today?
[01:03] Speaker 0: Yeah. Please go ahead. I can understand what you're doing now.
[01:07] Speaker 1: So today, actually, I have worked on a recommendation system. So in our chatbot, we've implemented this. So before actually giving the question, it will recommend us few questions. If we press on those questions, it will recommend few more questions, and it will answer them.
[01:26] Speaker 0: Wow. That's great. Thank you.
[01:29] Speaker 1: We had a great time. Thank you.
[01:32] Speaker 0: Bye bye.
