[00:06] Speaker 0: From the community. Three of our experiment. I mentioned Payment presents a new way to collaborate with AI, not as a single assistant, but as a team with assigned roles, each part of the development process become predictable, auditable, and transparent, which is essential for real engineering teams. Instead of improving, just tell me your idea, like your rules workflow. Clear hands of reputable processes. That's a big step toward AI augmented engineering discipline. Being a better a framework using AI agents like NMS, Dialog, or QA architecture to download software with architecture instead of robotic problem. If you want, I can also explain how to set up. Yeah. I'll build my projects step by step. Thank you for having.
